#summary How to install the guice plugin in Eclipse.

== *Alpha* Release ==

This is an alpha release of the plugin.  Please update often.

== Installation Overview ==

The Eclipse plugin is installed like any other Eclipse plugin: from an install site.
The install site is 
  http://guice-plugin.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/eclipse-update-site/


=== Step by Step Guide ===

  # In Eclipse, choose from the *Help Menu* the *Software Updates / Find and Install* item.
  # Choose *Search for new features to install* and click *Next*
  # Click *New Remote Site...*
  # Enter *Guice Plugin* for the Name
  # Enter *http://guice-plugin.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/eclipse-update-site/ *for the URL
  # Click *OK* and then *Finish*
  # Check the *Guice Plugin* box and hit *Finish*
  # Click the *I accept the terms in the license agreement* button (after being sure that you do) and click *Next*
  # Click *Finish*
  # After the download is complete, click *Install*
  # When prompted, restart Eclipse by saying *Yes*

=== @!ApplicationModule annotations ===

To make the best use of the plugin, you should download the !ApplicationModule jar from the Downloads section (it will be included in the next release of guice).  Then annotate your application modules accordingly (an application module is a module with a complete set of bindings).  The plugin by default will use modules annotated as !ApplicationModules as contexts.
